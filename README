Library info:
=========================
zlib version is 1.2.5
libpng version is 1.5.6
png++ version is 0.25

zlib1.dll must be placed either in C:\Windows\System32 (32-bit
Windows) or C:\Windows\SysWOW64 (64-bit Windows).

Some tiny tweaks were required to libpng and png++ to make
everything compile properly. All png++ tests pass except for
a few dealing with grayscale (though the output looks just
fine) - Aftermath
